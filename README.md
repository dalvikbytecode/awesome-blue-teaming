# Awesome Blue Teaming

Blue Team :

1. The group responsible for defending an enterpriseâ€™s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team).
2. A group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture.
